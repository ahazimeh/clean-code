/////// learn about polymorphism in classes

polymorphism with classes:
we have class Delivery
protected property purchase
2 methods called deliveryProduct and trackProduct with similar if conditions

if(a)cond1/4
if(b)cond2/5
if(c)cond3/6
we make 3 classes
class1 extends Delivery{
    deliveryProduct() {cond1}
    trackProduct() {cond1}
}.....
to get back to the video.............




clean classes should be small same as functions
what small means, with functions we had the concept of fns doing 1 thing
with classes there is a different concept, they should have signle responsibility

product class should have the responsibility of product related issues

Cohesion:
how much are your class methods using the class properties
maximum cohesion: all methods each use all class properties
no cohesion is the oposite
avoid using a class with no cohesion unless you want a data container with utitlity methods
