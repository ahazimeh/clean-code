types of bad comments:
    Redundant: when the name of the fn for example already explains what is happening
    Dividers/Block Markers: ex //classes when it is also obvious
    Misleading: ex: comments that contradict with the method name
    Commented Out Code: we are using git so we can just get rid of it
Good Comments:
    Legal Information
    Explanation Which can't be replaced by good naming
    Warnings
    Todo Note: ex // needs to be implemented
    
    Documentation Strings

Code Formatting:
    Verticle Formatting
    Horizontal Formatting
    Verticle Formatting:
        should be easy to read
        too big file: consider splitting it
        having blank lines to make code more readable
        related concepts should be close to each others when possible (methods that are calling each others for example)
        ordering: depends on the style guide of the language, example adding private methods before pulic or vice versa
    Horizontal Formatting
        avoid long unreadable lines
        use indentation
        split long lines into shorter multiple lines
        use clear but not long unreadable names
