minimize the number of parameters
the less parameters the better
functions with 3 parameters should be avoided if possible and with more than 3 should always be avoided
example: rather than saveUser(email, password) you can make it such that it takes no arguments
    user.save(); here you will have to initialize a user but it is expected to have multiple arguments in the constructor

const user = new User({name: 'Max', email: 'max@test.com', age: 31}); //takes 1 parameter
sumUp(1, -4, -15, 30) // this is a good function even though it could take as many parameters as we want

output parameters:
createIdUser(user) // this function adds id to the object user and these functions should be avoided
renaming it to addId will make it more obvious, here we have an output parameter but at least it is more expected
user.addId() will make it very obvious
